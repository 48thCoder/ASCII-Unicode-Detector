# ASCII & Unicode Character Detector
The ASCII & Unicode Character Detector is a simple yet useful web - based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its primary purpose is to help users quickly identify whether a given character belongs to the ASCII set or the broader Unicode set.

## 📍Tech Stack :
- **HTML**
  <br>
  For the input form and structure.
- **CSS**
  <br>
  For styling the interface, including layout, colors, and error/result messages.
- **JavaScript**
  <br>
  For character validation, detection logic, and dynamic message display.

## 📍Features :
- User Input Field - Allows users to enter a single character.
- Validation - If no character is entered, an error message is displayed in red.
- Detection Logic - If the character falls within the ASCII range (0 – 127), it is detected as an ASCII character. Otherwise, it is identified as a Unicode character.
- Interactive Output - Results are displayed dynamically beneath the input field, providing instant feedback.
- Clean UI - A modern, minimal, and responsive design with a centered input box, styled button, and clear result messages.

## 📍Working :
1) The user enters a character in the input box.
2) On clicking the Detect button, JavaScript checks the character’s code value.
3) If the code ≤ 127 → *Output : X is an ASCII character*.
4) If the code > 127 → *Output : X is an Unicode character*.
5) If no input is given, an error message is displayed.
